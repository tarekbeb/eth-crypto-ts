# eth-crypto-ts

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/eth-crypto-ts.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/eth-crypto-ts)

This repository is an open source that aims to transform `eth-crypto` to a typescript library.

It fixes a few issues with building as well as polyfilling node native packages.
This is particularily useful when using the package on a client or native environment where default node packages may not be availabe.

It has not been tested thoroughly yet due to time limitations, so use on your own risk. However I do not advise using it in a production environment.
